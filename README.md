# 🍰 Qatty Tatty
**Qatty Tatty** is a frontend prototype of a dessert (pancake) web application.  
The project is based on a custom UI/UX design and implemented using pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

It is intended both as a study project and as a realistic prototype that can be shown to a real client.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone the project  
2. Open `index.html` (or `login.html`) in a web browser  
3. No backend or server is required – everything works in the browser using `localStorage`

### Demo flow
- **Register & login as user**
  1. Open `login.html`
  2. Click **Register**, fill in the form
  3. Login using your email + password
  4. Check your data on `profile.html`

- **Login as admin**
  1. Go to `login.html`
  2. Enter email + password of an existing user
  3. Click **Login as admin** → the **Admin keyword** field appears
  4. Enter `ADMIN123`
  5. Click **Login as admin** again
  6. You will be redirected to the **Admin panel**, and in your profile you will see the **“Admin page”** button

## 🛠 Technologies

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, custom theme variables)  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – modular logic inside a single `script.js` file  
- **localStorage** – used as a simple in-browser “database” for demo

## 📌 Notes

- This is a **frontend-only prototype**:  
  - No real authentication, passwords are stored in `localStorage` just for demo.  
  - In a production version all sensitive logic (passwords, admin keyword, menu management) must be moved to a secure backend.

- The project can be extended with:
  - real backend API (Node.js / Django / etc.)  
  - secure authentication & roles  
  - order management and payment integration  
  - multi-language support (Kazakh / Russian / English)
